To use wOCR with wastedbot simply auth yourself in WasteDBoT
then open wOCR and click authorize, and type your wastedbot authname
as your auth for wOCR, the ocr should now say On and then you should
drag the clear box over your bot window and release, now when you 
sleep the ocr will automatically type the word approximately 95% of 
the time correctly.
