1+Introduction
WasteDBoT Scripting language is very similar to VB itself, it all works like this
Firstly, it uses subs. When the script is started it will run 'Main',
So it will search for this

@Sub Main()
'And run what is inside here
@End

From Sub Main you must create a simple loop to keep doing it until the script is
ended, to do that follow this.

@Sub Main()
Do While ScriptOn()
Call DoSomeShit
Loop
@End

Always use the Do While loop because its the safest and doesnt create stack
errors and other shit.
Also it stuffs up and crashes the script sometimes if you create an infinite
loop accidentally.

There is many commands, and to get a command list it comes with WasteDBoT.
To see the commands press 'Help' while in the bot.

2+Commands Usage
Commands are used as follows, Ill demonstrate with a simple command.

BotChat("Warning you are being ranged")

This will display a simple message in your chat logs like this

[WasteDBoT] - Warning you are being ranged

It is simple but it is an easy and good way to ask, tell or explain
anything while someone is using your script.

Sleep is also a common command, it pauses at intervals in ms(Milliseconds)
To pause for one second exactly you would use this 

Sleep(1000)

This tells the scripts to stop reading on for one second, you should use
these a lot in an average script.

3+Variables
Variables work very simply.
At the top of the page not inside a sub is where you place variables
that can be used for the entire script.

Variables inside a sub are temporary, and are no longer variables
after that sub is finished

To Create a variable use as following
Dim [MySexyVariableName]

For example Dim PhatesMom

Then in any sub I could do...

PhatesMom = "Hot"

That would simply make PhatesMom a 'String' and set its value to "Hot"
Simple enough eh?.

The way it works is you dont have to determine its type, it will itself
when it is set.
So forget Booleans, Integers and Strings. It will all be set when you set
it.

4+If Then Else
If Then Else are common commands used to compare a string, boolean or an
integer. Its usage is as Follows for a basic 'If' statement

If YourDad = "Gay" Then 'Note that 'YourDad' is a variable (String)
'Do Stuff
End If

For it to run the commands, YourDad would have had to been Dim'd and set
to "Gay".

Here is a more complicated example of using Else also

If YourDad = "Gay" Then 'Note that 'YourDad' is a variable (String)
'Hes gay
Else
'He is not gay
End If

And to get further on use of the 'ElseIf' statement becomes handy and saves
you a lot of typing.

If YourDad = "Gay" Then 'Note that 'YourDad' is a variable (String)
'Hes gay
ElseIf YourDad = "Straight" Then
'He is straight
ElseIf YourDad = "Unknown" Then
'He is unknown
Else
'?
End If

5+Left, Right and Mid
Left, Right and Mid are used to take parts of Strings and save you time.
They are basic and can be used for anything that requires a string.

If you wanted to know when you had talked to a banker you could use this

If Left(LastNPCChat, 4) = "Bank" Then
'Last thing Said started with "Bank"
Else
'Last thing Said did not start with "Bank"
End If

That should give you the point.
Right is obviously the same, but takes from opposite end, Now for Mid

Mid is for taking text out of a string anywhere.
This time it uses two integers, one where to start, one where to stop
So like this.

Mid("hello", 0, 3)

Would return "Hell" because '0' is the start, and '2' is the third
letter.

6+A Sum up
I hope this has taught you enough about scripting in WasteDBoT, but
if it has not, I suggest reffering to a 'VB' Manuall such as
"VB for Fucking stupid idiots (Like Me)" by Ed de Dumfuk

Nah actually just look for anything on VB or VBScript.
