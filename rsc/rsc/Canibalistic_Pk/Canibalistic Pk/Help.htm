</p>
<p>That was for the people that are already familiar with Canibalistic and know the basic commands.<br>
  Now for the people that are new or do not know how to use Canibalistic, here is each feature described and how to use it.</p>
<h2>Sleep At:</h2>
<p>This feature is self explanatory, what it does is sleep at the fatigue you specify by typing /sleep(fatigue here). Will only sleep when a macro is turned on. Remember you need an OCR to type for it or you can type your self, this bot does not have a OCR built in. </p>
<h2>Macro Delay:</h2>
<p>This is the time it will wait before attacking or theiving or auto clicking. For fighting and theiving, you usually should set it to between 200 and 1000, but for the auto clicker set it to the time you think it will take to click on the object and maybe wait for the fish to be caught or rock to be mined, usually about 2000 milli secs. </p>
<h2>Fight Menu: </h2>
<p>This feature enables and disables the fight menu that pops up when ever you are in combat. When you first log in to the bot, the fight menu will appear even though you are not in combat, if you wish you can leave it there but if you do not need it, simply press F2 and it will take it away. If anytime you feel like having the fight menu back, just press F2 again and the fight menu will come back.</p>
<h2>Force Logout:</h2>
<p>This makes you log out, but it is the same as the logout button in the main menu, just a short cut to it, just press F3. Remember this will log you out even if you are in combat or 10 seconds after combat have not passed yet, but if you do that, it will say that your account is already logged in, as it will not log you out of the main runescape server and you will not be able to log in for 1 minute. To avoid that happening only use it when you are not in combat and 10 seconds have passed sence you have been in combat. </p>
<h2>AutoLogin:</h2>
<p>This is a feature that you should use when autoing usually, so if anything happens(such as lag) and you log out, this feature will log you back into runescape automatically. To activate it, simply press F4 and it will say that you have activated autologin for your username and to disable it, press F4 again and it will say that you have disabled autologin for your username.</p>
<h2>Change Fight Mode:</h2>
<p>This feature changes your fight mode without you having to click it on the fight menu. Simply press F5 and it will toggle through the different fight modes from Controlled downwards:<br> 
---Controlled<br>
---Strength<br>
---Attack<br>
---Defence<br>
Dont worry it will say what mode you have set it to and if you are unsure just press F2 and it will open your fight menu(if you haven't already got it open) and you can see what mode it is set to.</p>
<h2>Player Lefties:</h2>
<p>This feature can be enabled and disabled in the main menu:</p>
<p><img src="http://img165.exs.cx/img165/202/menu6jn.png" width="196" height="261"> </p>
<p>As you can see near the top there is an option where you can turn leties on or off, at the moment it is on. This feature enables you to left click on any player while you are in the wilderness, very good for catching and fast attacking.</p>
<h2>Fast World Switch:</h2>
<p>This enables you to switch worlds at an amazing speed. To do this all you have to do is type in the chat window(runescape chat window) /hop(world here) and it will log you out and login to the specified world. Again make sure its been over 10 seconds after combat and you are not in combat.</p>
<h2>Set Default Food:</h2>
<p>This feature is to set what food is going to be used for the hotkey and when autoeating. To set the food id, type in the runescape chat window /food(food id here) and to eat that food with a hot key press &quot;Delete&quot; and it will eat the specified food id. To see what the food id is, examine the food and you will see the info about the food and the id. </p>
<h2>Zoom in and out:</h2>
<p>This enables you to see most of the map and you will be able to click further, to zoom out all you have to do is navigate using the up and down arrow. Down to Zoom out, meaning making the runescape window bigger and you can see more. Up to Zoom back in, as in get closer to your character. To see most of the map when zoomed out press F8 and this will get read of Fog Of War(this is the black shadow you see around you) and to enable the Fog of War just press F8 again.</p>
<h2>Prayer Hotkeys:</h2>
<p>This feature enables you to quickly turn on and off your selected prayer. The hotkeys can be set on the main menu, where all the lefties enabling is. The rest is self explanatory in the bot.</p>
<h2>Player HP:</h2>
<p>This feature again can be enabled and disabled through the main menu. What this feature does is enable you to see other players max and current hp, BUT only after they have been in combat and the bot has seen its hp bar and it will calculate the hp he was left with after combat and its max hp. When the bot doesnt know the player's hp because it hasnt seen the player fight yet, all you will see above that player's head is &quot;??&quot;.</p>
<h2>Fog of War:</h2>
<p>This is enabled by pressing F8. What it does is get rid of the black shadow that is around you, usually this feature is useful when you use to zoom out very far away to see more of runescape through your window and the black fog will be gone.</p>
<h2>DeathList:</h2>
<p>This feature is good when you want to show off to your friends all the people that you have killed. What it does is save the name of the person that you kill in wilderness or when staking. It will save it to a text file called DeathList.txt and you can open it to see. Also the time is shown next to each name to see the time you have killed the player at.</p>
<h2>Screeny Taker:</h2>
<p>To use this feature all you have to do is press F10 and it will take a picture of the runescape client window and only that window, then it will save the picture in the shots folder. Good for taking pictures of your stats or when you got a kill and you want to save the pile you got. </p>
<h2>Pk Map:</h2>
<p>This feature enables you to see the players in wildy that you can attack only. They will be shown on your mini map in the colour that usualy they look like, such as when they are a much higher level then you and they can still attack you or you can attack them, they will be in a dark brown colour or even red and if they are like 6 levels below you, you will see then in light yellow or in green colour. You can also press F11 and it will disable all the npcs and items on ground and will turn them in black colour so you dont confuse them with other players.</p>
<h2>Fast Talking:</h2>
<p>This feature enables you to repeat the last thing you said. To do this just press the &quot;Page Up&quot; key and you will say the last thing you said, but make sure you said something and do not hold the hotkey down, otherwise you will spam.</p>
<h2>Auto Fighter:</h2>
<p>This feature is the auto fighter, what it does is auto attacks the npc you have set it to. To activate the auto fighter press F6 and it will start attacking the npc you have set it to. To set the npc id, you either right click on an npc and select Set ID or just type /npc(npc id). </p>
<h2>Auto Eater:</h2>
<p>This feature can be used to pk or autofight. Just turn it on or off in the main menu and set the food you want to eat by typing /food(id here), to get the food id, right click on the food and select Examine and it will show the Id of the food or item you have selected. The auto eater will eat at the hp you have set it to, this can be done by typing /lowhp(hp here) and when your hp is at that level, it will eat the food you have selected. When there is no more food left, the autoeater will turn off automatically.</p>
<h2>Walk Back:</h2>
<p>This feaure is combined with the auto fighter, it can be enabled and disabled in the main menu. What it does is walk back to the square you have started at when there are no npcs around you anymore.</p>
<h2>Anti Wander:</h2>
<p>This feature is combined with the auto fighter, it can be enabled and disabled in the main menu. What it does is walk back to the square you started the auto fighter at when the character has passed the specified radius. You can set the radius by typing /walk( radius here).</p>
<h2>Macro Menu Panel:</h2>
<p>This is where you can activate the GuildMiner, Thiever and Auto clicker. To activate the panel all you have to do is press F9 and it will appear. Press the on/off button of the macro you would like to activate and watch it work, to stop press the on/off button again. </p>
<h2>Guild Miner:</h2>
<p>This feature is self explanatory and can be started in the Macro Menu Panel. This will mine coal in the Guild till full inventory and then will go to the bank and bank all the coal and gems if found any. You must be inside the guild when you start the guildminer.</p>
<h2>Theiver:</h2>
<p>This is like the auto fighter and has all the same features, except for attacking, what it does is theive from the selected npc and it will run away from fight if the npc attacks you. To activate the theiver you have to open the Macro Menu Panel and click the on/off button.</p>
<h2>Auto Clicker:</h2>
<p>This is a feature that is good to use for power mining or power fishing on the same spot. To set the coords where you want it to click, just click on the place and it will say Coords set to: and will show the coords you have set it to. Then it will click on that place with the delay you have set it to by typing /time( time in milli secs here). I recommend to activate auto login because it logs out after 5 minutes standing in the same spot.</p>
