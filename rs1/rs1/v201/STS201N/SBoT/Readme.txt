This is a folder for SBoT scripts to be used by 'Script'. 'Script' Is an open source STS script which comes with the bot, which allows you to run a large majority of SBoT scripts. Simply use /start Script to run the emulator. Once it is running you will see a list of SBoT scripts in your command prompt. You can run any of these using the normal SBoT method. ( /run <command> param1@param2@param3 ). SBoT scripts are stopped using F12, and should always be stopped before using /stop to stop the 'Script'.
