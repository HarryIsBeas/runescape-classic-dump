Commands like
//reload and //al (for turning on the anti logout)
are now ## instead of //

plus to reprint server information type ##ServInfo

Bitch bitch bitch.

I guess ill be flooded for a while, i havnt changed anything in
the AR crap yet, this versions kinda a beta to version v4
since re-doing just about everything scripting wise - 
Im sure there are bugs.

and...
the the system out print when you do a command, most commands are inaccurate
and actually useless bleh. You'll still be able to get the info i guess ...
