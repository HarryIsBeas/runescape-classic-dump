Ive been quite busy so i havnt beeen able to fix much stuffs, but i fixed some few:
- fixed talktountil(id), it only talked 10 times befor quit trying, now it talks 60 times!
- fixed a new auth server! omg here it goes, time to save up some money and buy an auth eh?
- fixed so you dont need to type down your auth/pass any more! (well only once) but its in the 
setup.ini file!,
- fixed so the hc.bmp are being saved outside the files folder, so its esier to find.

Fixed randomrune to work with mudclient 199..


[Added in 2.0]

This is randomrune fixed for mudclient 198. This version is the best version ever.
I added alot of commands, and also i have added a new style scripting system wich ressembles
Subanarks IT. Check the Commands.txt and JCommands.txt. Also dont forget to read the readme.


[Added in 1.7]

Some more shit for pkers added, check the f keys also pk minimap.
Added bunch of commands. Fixed alot of em too :)

Added a new picture to loading. Also added spawn function.
spawn(itemid)
Some of you might remember that from sab :)

[Added in 1.6]

Fixed sw. Now works perfectly... same code as evos runebot used and same as richyt sbot uses.
Added graffix off function <-- F4 -->
Now when dump is activated it dumps more commands then before :).
Cheers!
Dont forget to set the sleepwalker arpath to randomrune files fodler :D

[Added in 1.55]

Fixed the buying and selling of items. Now the command is buyitemid(id,price) and sellitemid(id,price)
Also put in a putitem(id) command for trading... but it doesnt seem to work.
Also added atobject2(xo,yo) and atobjectcoords2(x,y)
Also when the vb launcher tells you to update... dont do that.

[Added in 1.5]

I realised that sw still didnt work with sw... wich sucks. Well just wait a lil.
RichyT promised to teach me :)
Anyways finally added buyitemid(id) and sellitemid(id)

[Added in 1.4]

Added a few functions... also added better screenshot saving, now all screenshots
will be saved to screenshots folder... also now u can save more then 1 screenshot.
Btw the nr in the end of the bmp name is just a random number ;)

[Shoit in 1.35]


I didnt add much here, maybe a few commands... Anyways the main thing is i got to save the 
sleepword as bmp, now everytime u sleep the sleepword is saved in the rr file folder.
Now dont forget to set the arpath in sleepwalker.ini to the rr files folder.
ie ARPATH = C:\RR\Files
P.S. F3 saves screenshot to files folder

[Shit added in 1.3]

I added some shit, atobjectwithitem should work better now, also fixed the ifhpover part.
Added a beta on the dump function, it saves all (not all yet :P) ur actions to dump.txt when
its on. You can switch it on and off with F2. Also make sure Dump.txt exists in the Scripts folder
or else youll get tons of errors ;).


[Added in 1.2]

As usual i added some commands, wich you can just see from the commands.txt.
To point out firemaking is working now with command setfire(x,y) :).
Also /add(msg) ingame adds a msg to hi.txt in files folder.
Anyways peace out :)
I would also like to say is that randomrune will not be dead for long when mudclient updates
so dont fear that, also everyone who has bought an auth before that will still keep there auth :)
