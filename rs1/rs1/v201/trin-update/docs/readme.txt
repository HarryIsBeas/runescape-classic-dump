	|| autobot, came from my personal crappy bot, "MyBot" or later aXisBot was
	|| a pretty crappy bot, that did nothing special, started it in mc 196 it was
	|| never released, it used simple threads, and shit like that, not dissing threads,
	|| I am actually planning on releasing a thread bot when i get time called ABot
	|| (no not related to Sbot, but Abot = AutoBot short, but bleh), which will be using
	|| an idea Sean (RSCN guy) was talking about while he discriminated Slave one day.
	|| This idea I won't reveal yet, but hopefully it should be more reliable, and less
	|| glarable by Sean. 
	|| \----/
	|| So yeh, during mc 199, i started poking through java again, asking Sean for help
	|| here and there, then MC 201 came out, I had finished the (what i later called), 
	|| AB-Preset AutoFighter, and quickly converted it to MC201, with the neglect from Rp
	|| Slave died, and during Tina's pain, I started letting her use my bot. She liked it
	|| she was my first user other than myself, thanks :D. I Decided to release the bot to
	|| vets and mods/admins on the board, adding the Preset AutoThiever, i was under pressure
	|| to make the bot scriptable (like I said i would), and had released it a day after we moved
	|| to theintensity.com, (well privately still on slave 2 days before, but some stupid woman,
	|| who said some mean things to Tina and now isn't here, pasted the url link and etc to the
	|| public IRC channel). So yeh, i released the bot publicly, i had alot of people commenting
	|| on the bot's reliability, and called this bot AuToBoT-Able, because of Sean's disappearance
	|| I grabbed onto eXemplar for my source of java knowledge, me myself not knowing much java
	|| really at the time of making autobot, grew in knowledge quickly (from example), to make things
	|| better, and whatever, i then decided to re-code the bot from the beginning, a fresh deobed mc
	|| and started from scratch, I decided to call this bot AB Trinity, Trinity meaning three, and
	|| because i had just watched Blade Trinity for the 2nd time, and realised I liked the movie alot.
	|| At the beginning, i released the bot for 1 mill per auth, not permanete, but monthly - I thought
	|| a smart idea at the time, but now that there are several people owing fees, I'm seriously too lazy
	|| to go grab it. So yeh now prices are 2.5Mill for a -permanete- auth (kinda like Autorune's definition).
	|| Anyway, enough about history or whatever, most people wouldn't read this anyway, coz your a dickhead
	|| so lets get to the shit.

       //Index
       \\--------
	\\
	|| In This Version.txt - a usually bad (coz im lazy :P) editorial of what i've added this version.
	|| Readme.txt - Shit.
	|| TextCmds.txt - The "autorune style" scripting commands list.
	|| Scriptcmds.txt - AuToBoT'S java scripting commands list with sexy descriptions.
	|| Settings.ini - Appropriately renamed, thanks.
	|| shell.ini - The broken 'shellbot's' setting folder, you can try it, but It aint good :p
	|| quick.ini - The settings folder to run scripts quickly.
	|| AuToBoT.exe - This file must be run first so you can connect to runescape, to close it, right click it
	|| runprio.exe - You shouldn't need to run this yourself, and it is run by itself when you click...
	|| Run.bat - Click this to run the bot. :P
	|| shell.bat - runs the 'shellbot' with the settings from shell.ini
	|| /Scripts/ - Folder for Java Scripts
	|| /arscripts/ - Folder for the Text, "AR" Style Scripts.
	|| Anything else you probably shouldn't touch, look at, even think about, or you'll die.
	//_____
       //General Use
       \\--------
	\\
	|| F1 - Runescape's default use, to reduce graphic strain.
	|| F2 - Graphics Off
	|| F3 - BoT/LeGiT Mode
	|| F4 - Turns off your current auto.
	|| F5 - Pauses/UnPauses your current auto.
	|| F6 - 'Easy Catch' - a function that makes it easier to catch someone 2 sq se/nw.
	|| Scripts are run by //scriptname params. Ar Scripts are //Ar script.txt
	|| To reload scripts (without having to close the bot and re-open), type //reload
	|| In Bot Mode - Up/Down Zoom whatever. 
	//_____
       //The Inis.
       \\--------
	\\
	|| shell.ini is buggy, and I don't advise to use it, unless you just want to test it,
	|| user=rs-username : pass=rspass : script=AB java script (no AR) : mode=fightmode
	|| The server logged into comes from settings.ini..
	|| \----/
	|| Settings.ini is bleh less then i want it to be, someone give me more ideas for 'settings'
	|| bitches, or i delete your auths. Anyway:
	|| user=authuser : pass=authpass : server=default server on bot loading :
	|| mode=default fightmode to set to on login, if not autoing.
	|| \----/
	|| Quick.ini is an idea i thought up of (i believe :D), that makes it easier to run scripts
	|| without typing the whole thing everytime, you just could type //#1 -
	|| example in quick.ini you may have:
	|| 1=autofight npcs=3 - so if you typed //#1 - it would be the same as typing //autofight npcs=3
	|| you can have an unlimited amount of 'quick' scripts, so use it. *SMACK*.
