==== MS Java Runescape Color Hack ====
=  
=  This is a shitty little Java hack for
=  MS Java that overrides the Math class
=  temporarily, so you get non-changing 
=  colors.
=
=  The advantage is, it's updateproof, 
=  (needs no updating), and well, it's 
=  simple. Only works if you have (and
=  use) MS Java to Run Runescape.

=  It's quite self explanatory, just run
=  Run.bat
=
=  It works by temporarily replacing the 
=  MS Java archive which contains the Math
=  class. I did it this way because the 
=  java.util.zip package lacks any way to 
=  modify existing archives.
=
=
= Enjoy,
=   RegeX.
