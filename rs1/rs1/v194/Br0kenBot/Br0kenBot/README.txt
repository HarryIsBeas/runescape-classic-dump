Br0kenBot V.0.4

Ello all, This bot (Br0kenBot) is just all lil bot for the community, since most of you guys, all you do is complain about bots, the general section is only noobs complaining that there are no bots out and its really starting to piss me off. So I hope I wont see any more of "OMFG WHERE ARE TEH BOTS!!!!!11on1e1!". one other small note: if I see any one saying or even asking if theres a keylogger or it steals ur pw, I WILL TAKE DOWN THE LINK!

Features:

-f6: Autologin: it didnt work in earlier versions but it does now
-f7: start autofighter (autofighter is now universal meaning you can auto attack any attackable npc)
-f8: stop autofighter
-f9 through f12 cycles the autofighter modes (controlled, aggressive, accurate and defensive) IMPORTANT NOTE: if you press for example f10 which would go on aggressive, it will show it on controlled but u will only be gaining str exp
-Autosleeping: Its automatic, if you dont have a sleeping bag in your inventory, the bot will crash, you sleep at 96% fatigue.

Planned:

-Maybe autopickup if Im in a good mood
-Other tiny things
