-- Changing Worlds:

1.) Open "run.bat" with notepad,
2.) Edit the number at the end of the first line, example:
	"java -classpath yab.jar mudclient 29" = World 29
	"java -classpath yab.jar mudclient 31" = World 31
	"java -classpath yab.jar mudclient xx" = World xx.. [ replace "xx" with the number of the world you wan't to login to"
3.) File > Save,
4.) Run "run.bat" and that will now be the selected world.
