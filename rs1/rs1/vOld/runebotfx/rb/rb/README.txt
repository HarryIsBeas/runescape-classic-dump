Hello Again =)

I've recently returned to RSCheatNet and it's a little gloomy around,
People appreciate SCAR but of course they always hope for something better.

Anyways I've decided to release RuneBot one LAST time, Just for fun ;)
It's basically in your hands how long this lasts. As soon as jagex gets their hands on it or even hears about it,
boom they are going to update to kill it AGAIN. 

The best idea would be to basically keep it to yourself. The more people that get it, especially outside of the community, 
the greater the chances of jagex finding out about it and killz0ring it.

Anyways, Have fun Kids. :)
