---- Extra Information: ----

Please DO NOT "leech" my bot this simply means don't just give it out to anyone or friends have them register on the forums and find it and download it themselves. If your just gonna download the bot and not come onto the forums, your account will be deleted here. I also change the auth every once and a while just so you can't do that for a long time.
