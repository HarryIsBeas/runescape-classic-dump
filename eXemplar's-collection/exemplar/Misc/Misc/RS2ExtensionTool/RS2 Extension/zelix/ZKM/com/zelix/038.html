<li><a href="#list">Path list</a>

<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
This dialog sets the Stack Trace Translate classpath which is used by the tool at the time of analyzing your obfuscated bytecode.  
The <a href="035.html">Stack Trace Translate tool</a> searches the classpath for any classes that appear in the stack trace.
Note that for every class that appears in the stack trace being translated, the <a href="035.html">Stack Trace Translate tool</a> must be able to find and analyze  
<ul>
<li>the class
<li>any class that is directly or indirectly extended or implemented by the class
<li>any class accessed by the class.
</ul>
<p>
So as well as including the path to your obfuscated bytecode, the classpath must also include any support class libraries that your bytecode needs in order to run.
It must also include the Java bootstrap classes (eg. java.lang.Object). 

<h2><a name="list">Path list</a></h2>
The list of paths that make up the current classpath.  It must include a path to your supporting class libraries and the Java bootstrap classes.
<h2><a name="add">&quot;Add&quot; button</a></h2>
Click the <b>"Add"</b> button to open a file dialog. The dialog will allow you to select new paths to add to the path list.
<h2><a name="remove">"Remove" button</a></h2>
Removes the selected path from the path list.
<h2><a name="up_">"Move Up" button</a></h2>
Moves the selected path upwards within the list.  The list order represents the search order. Paths at the top will be searched first.
<h2><a name="down">"Move Down" button</a></h2>
Moves the selected path downwards within the list.  The list order represents the search order. Paths at the bottom will be searched last.
