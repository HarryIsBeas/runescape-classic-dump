<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
This dialog sets the Zelix KlassMaster classpath. The classpath is used at the time of analyzing, trimming and obfuscating your classes.  
Zelix KlassMaster<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> searches the classpath for any classes (not opened for processing) which are accessed by classes which you <b>have</b> opened for processing.
Possible examples are API or 3rd party classes.  Note that <b>Zelix KlassMaster must be able to find and analyze every
class that is directly or indirectly extended or implemented by your classes</b>.
<p>
Also note that the Zelix KlassMaster classpath must also include the Java bootstrap classes (eg. java.lang.Object).  
It is highly recommended that the classpath specify the bootstrap classes corresponding to the classes being processed regardless of which JVM 
you are using to run Zelix KlassMaster. 
For example, if you are processing classes compiled using a 1.2 compiler then you should specify the 1.2 bootstrap classes in the Zelix KlassMaster classpath.  
<h2><a name="list">Path list</a></h2>
The list of paths that make up the current classpath.  It must include a path to the Java bootstrap classes appropriate for your classes.
<h2><a name="add">"Add" button</a></h2>
Click the <b>"Add"</b> button to open a file dialog. The dialog will allow you to select new paths to add to the list.
<h2><a name="remove">"Remove" button</a></h2>
Removes the selected path from the classpath.
<h2><a name="up_">"Move Up" button</a></h2>
Moves the selected path upwards within the list.  The list order represents the search order. Paths at the top will be searched first.
<h2><a name="down">"Move Down" button</a></h2>
Moves the selected path downwards within the list.  The list order represents the search order. Paths at the bottom will be searched last.
