<h1>Zelix KlassMaster Overview</h1>
The basic steps to using Zelix KlassMaster<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> are 
<ul>
   <li>set the Zelix KlassMaster classpath so that Zelix KlassMaster can locate any classes accessed by your application (eg. API or 3rd party classes),
   <li>open the classes within your application which you wish to trim and/or obfuscate,
   <li>trim and/or obfuscate your opened classes,
   <li>save your processed classes.
</ul>
If you would like the Zelix KlassMaster &quot;<a href="012.html">Build Helper</a>&quot; to guide you through all of the above steps, select the <b>&quot;Run Build Helper&quot;</b> button, then click the <b>&quot;Next&quot;</b> button.
<p>
If you would rather use the GUI, it is recommended that you allow Zelix KlassMaster to guide you through the setting of the classpath and the opening of your classes.  
This will reduce the likelihood of error due to the classpath not being set correctly prior to the opening of your classes.  
To do this, select the <br><b>&quot;Set classpath and open classes&quot;</b> button, then click the <b>&quot;Next&quot;</b> button.
Once the classpath is set and your classes are open, you can perform the remaining steps by choosing the following menu options in turn:
<ul>
   <li><b>&quot;<a href="020.html">Tools | Trim</a>&quot;</b> and/or 
       <b>&quot;<a href="025.html">Tools | Obfuscate</a>&quot;</b> to trim and/or obfuscate your classes,
   <li><b>&quot;<a href="019.html">File | SaveAll</a>&quot;</b> to save your processed classes.
</ul>
<p>
Alternatively, if you prefer to perform all of the steps using the Zelix KlassMaster GUI, you can do so by 
first clicking on <b>&quot;Cancel&quot;</b> to close the current window, 
then by choosing the following menu options in turn:
<ul>
   <li><b>&quot;<a href="017.html">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Classpath</a>&quot;</b> to set the classpath, 
   <ul>
      <li>Note: The Classpath must be correctly set prior to the opening of your classes.  If 
         Zelix KlassMaster is unable to locate all of the required classes within the specified Classpath, 
         then an error will be displayed at the <b>&quot;<a href="018.html">File | Open</a>&quot;</b> step or at a later step.
   </ul>
       <li><b>&quot;<a href="018.html">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Open</a>&quot;</b> to open your classes,
       <li><b>&quot;<a href="020.html">Tools&nbsp;|&nbsp;Trim</a>&quot;</b> and/or 
           <b>&quot;<a href="025.html">Tools&nbsp;|&nbsp;Obfuscate</a>&quot;</b> to trim and/or obfuscate your classes,
       <li><b>&quot;<a href="019.html">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;SaveAll</a>&quot;</b> to save your processed classes.
</ul>
<p>
Zelix KlassMaster also contains the &quot;ZKM Script&quot; scripting language which provides more sophisticated functionality.  
If you would prefer to use ZKM Script instead of the Zelix KlassMaster Build Helper or GUI, 
use <b>&quot;<a href="011.html">Tools | ZKM Script Helper</a>&quot;</b> to generate the basic ZKM Script.  
Once your script has been created and saved, you can enhance the script to include more sophisticated statements by using any text editor.
<p>
If you are <b>evaluating</b> Zelix KlassMaster it is recommended that you use the &quot;Build Helper&quot; as the first step in your evaluation.  
This is because the Zelix KlassMaster Evaluation version will allow you to open only five classes using &quot;ZKM Script&quot;.
