<h1>Overview</h1>
The basic steps to using Zelix KlassMaster<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> are 
<ul>
   <li>set the Zelix KlassMaster classpath so that Zelix KlassMaster can locate any classes accessed by your application (eg. API or 3rd party classes),
   <li>open the classes within your application which you wish to trim and/or obfuscate,
   <li>trim and/or obfuscate your opened classes,
   <li>save your processed classes.
</ul>
You can use the Zelix KlassMaster <A HREF="012.html">Build Helper</A> to guide you through all of the above steps by choosing the menu option: <b>&quot;Tools&nbsp;|&nbsp;Build Helper&quot;</b>.
<p>
Alternatively, if you prefer to perform all of the steps using the Zelix KlassMaster GUI, you can do so by choosing the following menu options in turn:
<ul>
   <li><b>&quot;Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Classpath&quot;</b> to <A HREF="017.html">set the classpath</A>, 
   <ul>
      <li>Note: The Classpath must be correctly set prior to the opening of your classes.  
          If Zelix KlassMaster is unable to locate all of the required classes within the specified Classpath, then an error will be displayed at the <b>&quot;File | Open&quot;</b> or later step.
   </ul>
       <li><b>&quot;File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Open&quot;</b> to <A HREF="018.html">open your classes</A>,
       <li><b>&quot;Tools&nbsp;|&nbsp;Trim&quot;</b> and/or <b>&quot;Tools&nbsp;|&nbsp;Obfuscate&quot;</b> to <A HREF="020.html">trim</A> and/or
          <A HREF="025.html">obfuscate</A> your classes,
       <li><b>&quot;File&nbsp;|&nbsp;SaveAll&quot;</b> to <A HREF="019.html">save</A> your processed classes.
</ul>
<p>
Zelix KlassMaster also contains the ZKM Script scripting language which provides more sophisticated functionality.  
You can use the <A HREF="011.html">Script Helper</A> to generate the basic ZKM Script by choosing the menu option <b>&quot;Tools | ZKM Script Helper&quot;</b>.  
Once your script has been created and saved, you can enhance the script to include more sophisticated statements by using any text editor.
<p>
If you are <b>evaluating</b> Zelix KlassMaster it is recommended that you use the &quot;Build Helper&quot; as the first step in your evaluation.  
This is because the Zelix KlassMaster Evaluation version will allow you to open only five classes using &quot;ZKM Script&quot;.
