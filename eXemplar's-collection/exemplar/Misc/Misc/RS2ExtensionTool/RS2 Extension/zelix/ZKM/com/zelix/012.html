<h1>Build Helper</h1>
The ZKM Build Helper will guide you through the <sup>1</sup>basic steps of trimming and/or obfuscating your classes.  
The Build Helper is handy for evaluating Zelix KlassMaster.  However, because each step is executed online, using the Build Helper can be time consuming for large applications.  
Therefore you should consider using ZKM Script as an alternative.  
(You can use the <a href="011.html">ZKM Script Helper</a> to create a basic ZKM Script.)

The Build Helper will lead you through a sequence of steps that will allow you to:
<ul>
   <li>set the classpath that Zelix KlassMaster<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> should use,
   <li>open your classes,
   <li>set your trim exclusions,
   <li>trim your classes,
   <li>set your name obfuscation exclusions,
   <li>obfuscate your classes,
   <li>save your trimmed and/or obfuscated classes.
</ul>

<p>
You can exit the sequence at any time by pressing the <b>&quot;Cancel&quot;</b> button. Because Zelix KlassMaster will actually be altering 
the opened classes as you progress through each step, you will not always be able to return to an earlier window.
<p>
<sup>1</sup><font size=-1>If you wish to use the more sophisticated functionality that is available in Zelix KlassMaster, you can save the 
ZKM Script which is generated by the Build Helper, and then enhance the script using any text editor.</font>
