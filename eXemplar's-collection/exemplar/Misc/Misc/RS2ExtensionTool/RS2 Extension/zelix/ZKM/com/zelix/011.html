<h1>ZKM Script Helper</h1>
The Script Helper will lead you through the steps required to create a basic ZKM Script file.  
The Script Helper should be used in preference to the&nbsp;<a href="012.html">Build Helper</a>&nbsp;for larger applications or complex applications. 
These are more conducive to errors during the online execution of steps by the Build Helper.
<p>
Once the Script Helper has completed its task of generating and saving the ZKM Script file, you can enhance the script file using any text editor, and then execute the script file from the command line.
<p>
The ZKM Script Helper will help you create a basic ZKM Script file by leading you through a sequence of dialog screens. 
These screens will allow you to build a ZKM Script that will
<ul>
   <li>set the classpath that Zelix KlassMaster<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> should use,
   <li>open your classes,
   <li>set your trim exclusions,
   <li>trim your classes,
   <li>set your name obfuscation exclusions,
   <li>obfuscate your classes,
   <li>save your trimmed and/or obfuscated classes.
</ul>

<p>
You can exit the sequence at any time by pressing the <b>&quot;Cancel&quot;</b> button. You can return to an earlier step by pressing the <b>&quot;Previous&quot;</b> button.
