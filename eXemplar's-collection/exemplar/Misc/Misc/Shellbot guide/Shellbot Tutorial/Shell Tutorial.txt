-Hey Bitches.
--Time for the tutorial to save your RAM and your modem bandwith.
---All files needed for shell are included in this .zip
----Before you proceed with this tutorial paste the data folder from your IxBot into the "Files" folder that this document came in 
-----(it made the difference of being able to attach to forums or not so i had to delete it out)

-	Well, first I made a shell control center file, which is not necessary but easier so you can keep all logs in 1 spot.
-	If you did this you will need to paste your IxBot data and scripts into the folder (already done in the “Files” folder).
-	If not, just skip part 1.


----If you want shell control center as separate folder
-	After you have made your control center file simply paste all contents of the “Files” folder into it. 
-	This folder is for keeping shell logs and using the Shell Control Center to kill bots, resume bots, stop bots, and watch bots.

-----Getting files in place
-	Take the “Files2” folder and paste it into all IxBot folders.

----Starting the control center
-	Start up “shellbot.bat” in either your new control center folder or in any regular IxBot folder.
-	When started should read “Starting Control Center on 0.0.0.0:55555”

----Setting up individual shells
-	Start “shellbot.bat” (this will connect to control center, or if first one you opened will act as control center)
-	Start “copy of shellbot.bat” (this will open the individual shell)
-	The new dos window should read “Welcome to ixBot control center master!”

-----Open the needed AutoRune
-	If you are still in the folder you opened the new shell from open an “AutoRune.exe”
-	Auth the AutoRune with your ix auth user/pass
-	Go to “Misc ->Login Settings-> Prevent Logouts” and choose it
-	Go to “Misc -> Lag Safe Mode” and choose it
-	Set the world you wish to log into

-----Setting up your shell
-	You will now have to get a little technical.
-	Type “Start bot1” (bot1 can be anything, I use numbers according to folders, and folders according to names that I have specified)
-	This should make it respond “Paste properties for bot "bot1" here (a dot on a single line ends the input):”
-	Now you must configure your properties, for the property setup just open the “Shell Properties.txt” in the folder with this tutorial.
-	After modifying the properties to fit your needs simply copy them, including the # lines(the shell excludes them) and then paste into your shell (right click->paste)
-	Then if you are on the line below all of the info press “.” then the “Enter/Return” key.
-	It should connect through the AutoRune you have opened from the same folder.

------Paste/open your script
-	Now paste or open the AutoRune script you wanted if you choose “ScriptStep0 = 66”, make sure you are at the starting point so it works correctly.

-----Other shell commands
-	I know of a few shell commands that you type either into the shell or the control center, they are:
-kill “name” –will stop the script and stop writing to the log.
-stop “name” –stops the AutoRune script or the ix script running
-resume “name” –will resume script after stopping
-watch “name” –displays EVERYTHING that is said, recieved,debugged

----How to totally stop a char
-	To totally stop a char running on shell type these 2 commands
-	Stop “name” -> kill “name”
-	Then exit the AutoRune used to connect.
