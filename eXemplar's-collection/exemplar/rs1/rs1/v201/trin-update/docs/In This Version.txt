Hi,

In this version, I've done too much, and over 2 weeks of me planning an update
ive added shitloads, and forgot what i've done.

Main things can be though of course:
AuToBoT.exe ;)
Fixing of getNpcByIdWithIn 
New Help/Read Files.
Made making text scripting slightly more easier, due to the fact if a java error
EVER occured, (like due to putting a white space somewhere or something), 
the bot would freeze, and you would have to reload the bot, now it will just
turn off the script, and tell you what line the error is on.

I hopefully fixed up the error of judgement, by putting some shit somewhere I
shouldn't off, resulting in gayness :( Sorry folks. This should be fixed now.

Also added isPrayerOn(num)
Trading Commands :O
public int getTradeScreen()
doPutTrade(int[] ids, int[] amms)
doAcceptTrade(int i)
isTradeAccepted()

and a character creating commands
doCreateUser(String user, String pass)
setLooks(int a, int b, int e, int f, int g, int h)

Oh yeh, also fixed several mix ups with the text scripting,
often when it says ById, it was doing it my inventory space, and the one without
ById was doing it by id, people who I told to just put something else in there
scripts, must now edit them back - thanks.

Also, you no longer need a data folder, as your datas are loaded from your system, rather
then a seperate folder. ;).
