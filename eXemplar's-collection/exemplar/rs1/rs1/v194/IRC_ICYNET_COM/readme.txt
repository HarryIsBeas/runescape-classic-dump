---Credits---
SubAnark - An inspiration to programmers/hackers, He's done a lot for the community wether you know it or not, I'm 
using your loader, and your original method for doing mudclient hacks. <3
Sean - Trusted me with SITE, Taught me a lot about java and stuffs....Thanks for the noob help
Saevion - Very sexy, always helping me out with stuff, or just someone to talk to. Great java programmer/scripter.
Faketrix - I used your loader since i'm too lazy to put one together myself. Its nice of you to try 
and give people a push on creating their own bots/etc..:)
Evo - You don't have anything to do with this bot, but you are an important figure in rs cheating.
RichyT - You are a fast learner, SAB is a pretty decent bot,
 Also I was stupid for thinking you copied so much code from SITE, Your bot is actually pretty original ;)

---Info---
This is a simple bot for runescape. It's main feature is an autofighter. I hope to expand on this bot in 
the future, So if you have any suggestions or found a bug let me know by contacting me on IRC or on the 
rscheatnet forums. 

---How to use---
This bot was created using Sun Java Technologies and I don't believe it is compatible with Microsoft Java. Sun are
the original creators of Java and you should download their JVM/JRE from www.java.com or java.sun.com

Please read how-to-use.txt for commands and features.

Please note: This bot doesn't contain a lot of advanced features like autologin or eating, or checking if you can reach 
an npc. It would be best to train in a place where you won't need food and where you can reach all npcs of that type.

---risk---
Once you've decided to cheat, you need to realize there is a risk of losing your character and your items. If you don't
want to get banned, You should play manually. You can always train a noob automatically as many people do..Jagex won't ban
your main character for autoing your noob in most cases.

I claim no liability if you get your ass banned.

---Future---
i don't have a todo list for this bot anymore as i've grown tired of working on it. report bugs in #RSAF on irc.icynet.com and ill fix em asap

---Up to you---
meh this bot is public now. but I better not see anyone making their own RSAF channels on rscheatnet or autorune. keep it on irc.icynet.com. Please idle in #RSAF as well THANKS!!


Thanks for your support everyone,
