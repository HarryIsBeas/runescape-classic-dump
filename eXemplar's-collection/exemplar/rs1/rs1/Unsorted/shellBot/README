====================== STSHell - shellBot source ====================

Source released 27/12/05. STSHell is a macro program for runescape
classic. It was originally released to reinet.co.uk members, allowing
users to run large amounts of characters on one bot. Shortly after
releasing servers began to fill up and runescape classic was updated,
to be reopened as members only. Some people blamed shellbot for this,
some assumed it just accelerated the process, and others thought it
to just be a coincidence.
