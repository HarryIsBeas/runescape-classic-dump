this is a simple modification to version 218 of runescape2 that removes map rotation for scar
it was only tested on sun java
we are not 100% sure if jagex can detect this yet, but most likely they can't

currently the server it connects to is hardcoded into serverlist.class but i will come up with a better way next time, this is just temporary. by default it connects to server 1 (ul2.runescape.com)
