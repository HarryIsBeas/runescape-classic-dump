The first thing you need to do is run setup.bat which will download the files you need from
Jagex File Server. (The runescape graphics, maps, sprites, etc)...
If you do not feel safe running the setup script I will zip all the files you need. See channel for more info.

To startup RuneBot, Run f2p.bat or p2p.bat depending on if you have members or not. If you would rather play
directly from your browser you will need to disable all security checks in your browser, which is not very
wise and you still may have problems.

RB features:
runebot autosleeps once you reach a certain fatigue level. The default is 100% fatigue but you can adjust it
by pressing F11 to decrease and F12 to increase. You must have a sleeping bag to autosleep. (Obviously)

runebot allows for fast server switching by taking the last character of your username.
