Sort of like waamp but better. Use the lamp procedures where you normally would in a script with par1.0... When you see a health bar(get color clread and clgreen) use check4plant(sorry i was too lazy to make a better procedure). This is the beta par 2.0, i have the full version but im not gonna release it yet because, it still freezes sometimes. 

Use CheckPAR; to check if par has found a random, it will only stop the script if theres a random, and only for you... When using par2.0 make sure you go to par2.scar and put in your username EXACTLY how a random would say it... such as pplsuqbawlz would be "Pplsuqbawlz".

Uhh good day and Ive gotten an average 50% better scipt functioning when the 2nd scar is the thing scanning for randoms. Other than this? have fun people :).
