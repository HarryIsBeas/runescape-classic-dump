Optical Character Recognition System for Runescape
**************************************************

[Starting up]
If you get problems running for the first time - relaunch
DOCR and try again.

[How this works]
You need a compatible bot like Tbot or Sbot

The ocr looks for the sleepword saved as .bmp
then it will read the sleepword and save it
in a specified textfile which the bot will
have to read out of.

[Other Errors]
If you get errors you don't have certain dll files
search google for the needed ones and put then in the
DOCR folder.

*(Extra Info)*
In 1996 Dolly the sheep, who became famous as the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell, has died.

MP and I have named this OCR after the famous sheep.
