<b>Will I get banned?</b><br>
RS Advanced (RuneScape Advanced) loads the RuneScape client directly from RuneScape.com 
in a fast and clean method. <strong>There is no danger of being detected</strong> 
as in other Automaters such as RuneBot (originally by Vee) or other modified RuneScape 
clients, because as far as Jagex™ can tell your playing right off RuneScape.com. 
<strong>The only way you could get discovered is by someone reporting you</strong>, 
so <strong>dont be stupid</strong> and auto in full worlds in a popular place. 
Best place to auto is in a remote location on a near empty world.</font>
