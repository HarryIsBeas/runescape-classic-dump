~~~Important Actions~~~
Setting Colours - You put the cursor over the colour you wish to set and press `(top left) followed by 'c' or 'v' depending on the slot you wish to store it in. The colour is displayed in options.

the ` button make the program listen for the next keyboard input, if you cannot find ` you can use the 'Input' button at the top of the program in replace of `, it does exactly the same thing.
