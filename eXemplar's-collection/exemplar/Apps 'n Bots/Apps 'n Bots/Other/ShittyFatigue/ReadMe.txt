ShittyFatigue 1.0 - By Faketrix/Powelly

ShittyFatigue is made to be implanted in to Java RuneScape bots.

The idea is... When the RuneScape character sleeps, the java bot should;

1)
Save the sleepword as: HC.bmp

2)
Save the following text: SleepyTime
In the file: Sleep.dat

If you know how to do the two above things and want to help out others, maybe make a tutorial in the Java section about saving images and text?

This program is for "bot makers", but can be used by all when implanted within a bot.

There is no set 'Fatigue Operator' like ColdFeet SW has, but someone has to type words... so idle in irc.autorune.org #shittyfatigue

If a user with [SF] in their IRC nickname says:

"Shit on my fatigue pls: http://powelly.com/SF/imagename.bmp"

Then you click the link, read the word...

and then reply to it with by typing the following in IRC:

"!shitword username word"
*username being their IRC nickname
* word being the sleepword

Thats all   =)
